Welcome to Galileo. 

## What is Galileo?

Galileo is an ML Data Intelligence platform on a mission to enable ML teams to always work with the highest quality training data across the ML lifecycle.
Avoiding model and data health drops across the ML workflow is mission critical but involves messy grunt work. Galileo makes this process systematic by ensuring proactive, collaborative data debugging leveraging the latest data-centric AI research, to mitigate biases, identify data errors and dramatically increase model accuracy.

That was a lot of words. Head over to www.rungalileo.io to try Galileo yourself.
