Welcome to Galileo. 

## What is Galileo?

Galileo is an ML Data Intelligence platform on a mission to enable ML teams to always work with the highest quality training data across the ML lifecycle.
Avoiding model and data health drops across the ML workflow is mission critical but involves messy grunt work. Galileo makes this process systematic by ensuring proactive, collaborative data debugging leveraging the latest data-centric AI research, to mitigate biases, identify data errors and dramatically increase model accuracy.

That was a lot of words. Head over to www.rungalileo.io to try Galileo yourself.

## Galileo Product Support

This is Galileo's public repository to gather Bugs and Feature Requests from users.

Please help us help you fix your ML data. We love feedback. Let us know what you think by filing bugs, feature requests, or starting a discussion with the Galileo community.

We _recommend_ that you search the issue tracker to check if someone else already reported the same issue or whether there's a known solution to your problem. This would be the fastest way for you to find a solution to any issue that you are currently facing.

If you're adding a bug report, please add detailed steps to reproduce the bug. The more context you give us in a concise way, the easier it will be for us to help you.
